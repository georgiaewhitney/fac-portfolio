## 1. Structure a site using semantic HTML to aid accessibility

Using semantic HTML elements aids accessibility by better representing the functionality of parts of the site. This is especially helpful for screen readers. 

Our project used semantic HTML elements instead of more generic elements like so:

```html:
<header>
<nav></nav>
</header>
...
<section id="title">
</section>
```

Users can determine the purpose of our elements at a glance. Here we used `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<section>` elements, over `<div>` in order to indicate their purpose. We used `<div>` and `<span>` elements for layout purposes within more semantic sections.

## 2. Make a web page more readable for screen readers

In addition to the semantic HTML elements aforementioned, we ensured our `<img>` elements included alt-text and used aria parameters for elements in the form that would otherwise be anonymous. 

```html!
<img src="./images/portfolio-1.jpeg" alt="screenshot of a website design of two large rows, spanning the full width of its page" />
```

## 3. Design a UI without relying solely on colour, so that we donâ€™t exclude colour-blind users

The site design relies on sections with a dark/light contrast between each, rather than colour. The functionality does not rely on colour to differeniate elements. 

For example, the navigation bar uses hover states with a dark to light hover state to inform the user of a link. A pointer is also used to indicate this furhter.
